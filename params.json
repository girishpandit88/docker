Providing them right set of tools to start with can go a long way into creating good impression of the team on the new engineer. This project was initiated with that view. Currently the dev-in-box brings up memcached, DynamoDb and tomcat all in a single vagrant box with port forwarding setup to host machine.\r\n\r\nCurrently I've dockerized 3 containers - \r\n* AWS DynamoDB local\r\n* memcached\r\n* Tomcat 8.0.30 with debug mode enabled\r\n\r\n![devinbox.png](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/girishpandit88/docker/develop/images/devinbox.png)\r\n\r\nThese containers are using docker-compose vagrant plugin to run as lxc-docker containers. Use the following command to install the vagrant docker-compose plugin\r\n\r\n```bash\r\nvagrant plugin install vagrant-docker-compose\r\n```\r\n\r\nTo get started simply execute - \r\n```bash\r\nvagrant up\r\n```\r\n\r\nTo inspect docker containers - \r\n```bash\r\nvagrant ssh\r\ndocker ps\r\n```","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
